How to use Decision Tree:

It will prompt the user with their preferred attribute selection measure of either using
either information gain, majority error, or gini index to calculate the decision tree. The user
must enter either 1, 2, or 3 respectively and press enter. 

It will then prompt the user with a tree depth of choice, 1 through 6. The user must enter a number 1
through 6 and click enter, then the decision tree will go to work.

How to use Adaboost, bagging, random forest, LMS with batch-gradient and stochastic gradient:

It will prompt the user with their preferred selection of adaboost, bagging, random forest, or LMS.
When the user selects LMS, it will prompt the user with batch-gradient and stochastic gradient.

All parameter changes will be prompted to the user with options, and the user enters the number corresponding with the option
